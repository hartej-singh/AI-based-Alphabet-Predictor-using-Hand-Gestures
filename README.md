# AI-based-Letter-Predictor-using-Hand-Gestures

This is a CNN model (Convolution Neural Network) that takes in a static image as input of a hand gesture and gives an output of the predicted letter.

To run, execute the AI model code and generate a .h5 file. Copy-paste that model-save file in the Flask folder.
